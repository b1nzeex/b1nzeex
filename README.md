### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on multiple projects to make open source to further develop my skills in various different languages and frameworks!

- ðŸ”Ž You can find my portfolio [here](https://cbeachx.me)!

- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying a HNC in Computing at Heart of Worcestershire College where I am learning theory and practical in programming!

- ðŸ‘¯ As part of my Personal Development Plan for my HNC assignment, I have challenged myself to collaborate with somebody on a project - if you want to collaborate, go ahead and send me project ideas via Discord! If I like your idea, I will collaborate and work on the project with you - you will also be required to show me your past work (I would like to do a project using NodeJS and/ or React).

- ðŸ“« You can reach me via Discord, my tag is eSkuzi#0001

- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him!

- âš¡ Fun Fact: I like to watch Dhar Mann!
